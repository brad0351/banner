# Banner

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Make the layout that matches the screenshots by using classes from [Typografier](https://typografier.web-dev.tools/) and writing a few lines of CSS in `main.css`
- You’ll need to get a copy of the type system from Typografier and paste it into `type.css`
- The HTML is mostly complete: it just needs some classes added to it.
- The CSS is mostly complete: just the `.banner` and `.banner-content` classes need properties.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
